The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

- `gflownet`: This is the main library that all the files depend on. It provides the `Node` class and the `connect` and `compile` functions.

- `statePrior`: This is a variable that is used in the `state_node` definition. It is likely defined in the `statePrior.py` file and imported into the main script.

- `qudPrior`: This is a variable that is used in the `qud_node` definition. It is likely defined in the `qudPrior.py` file and imported into the main script.

- `utterancePrior`: This is a variable that is used in the `utt_node` definition. It is likely defined in the `utterancePrior.py` file and imported into the main script.

- `literalMeanings`: This is a variable that is used in the `meaning_node` definition. It is likely defined in the `literalMeanings.py` file and imported into the main script.

- `literalListener`: This is a variable that is used in the `listener_node` definition. It is likely defined in the `literalListener.py` file and imported into the main script.

- `speaker`: This is a variable that is used in the `speaker_node` definition. It is likely defined in the `speaker.py` file and imported into the main script.

- `pragmaticListener`: This is a variable that is used in the `pragmatic_listener_node` definition. It is likely defined in the `pragmaticListener.py` file and imported into the main script.

- `model`: This is a variable that is used to store the compiled GFlowNet model. It is used in the `model.sample()` function call.

- `model.sample()`: This is a function that is used to sample from the model. It takes the nodes as arguments and returns the sampled values.
